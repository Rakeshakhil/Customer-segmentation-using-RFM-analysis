Customer Segmentation using RFM Method
This project is focused on segmenting customers based on their purchasing behavior using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) method. RFM analysis is a customer segmentation technique that enables businesses to identify and target their most valuable customers by analyzing their buying behavior.

Data
The data used in this project is a transactional dataset that contains customer purchase history for a specific time period. The data should contain customer ID, purchase date, and purchase amount.

Methodology
Recency: Analyze how recently a customer has made a purchase. Customers who made a purchase more recently are likely to be more valuable.

Frequency: Analyze how frequently a customer makes a purchase. Customers who make more frequent purchases are likely to be more valuable.

Monetary: Analyze how much a customer has spent on purchases. Customers who spend more money are likely to be more valuable.

These three factors (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) are combined to create an RFM score for each customer. The RFM score is used to segment customers into different groups based on their value.

Implementation
The project will be implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook. The steps involved in the project are:

Data preprocessing and cleaning
Calculation of RFM scores for each customer
Customer segmentation based on RFM scores
Visualization of customer segments
Interpretation and analysis of customer segments
Results
The output of this project will be a segmentation of customers based on their RFM scores, along with a visualization of the segments. This information can be used by businesses to create targeted marketing campaigns, improve customer experience, and increase customer retention.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the RFM method is a powerful tool that enables businesses to identify and target their most valuable customers. This project provides a step-by-step guide on how to implement RFM analysis using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The results of this analysis can help businesses make data-driven decisions that can improve their bottom line.
